# qudini-reactive-metrics

Provides an easy integration of custom metrics, as well as health checks following the Kubernetes kubelet design. 

## Installation

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.qudini</groupId>
        <artifactId>qudini-reactive-metrics</artifactId>
        <version>${qudini-reactive.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Depending on your monitoring system: -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Configuration

You can leave the defaults, everything will just work out of the box. You can also reconfigure it to match your requirements, as explained in the following sections.

### Build info

A `Gauge` meter named `build_info` will be registered to expose the build name and version via tags.

By default, those two values will be read from the JAR file's manifest, respectively `Implementation-Title` and `Implementation-Version`.

You can override this behaviour by registering a component implementing `com.qudini.reactive.metrics.buildinfo.BuildInfoService`.

### Probes

A new `liveness` endpoint will be registered, simply returning 200 OK. You'll need to expose it via Spring Boot Actuator.

Below is our recommended configuration of Spring Boot Actuator, especially if orchestrated by Kubernetes:

```yaml
server:
  # the "exposed" server port
  port: ${SERVICE_APP_PORT:8080}

management:
  server:
    # use a different "private" port for Spring Boot Actuator:
    port: ${SERVICE_MNG_PORT:8081}
  endpoint:
    health:
      # make the health (aka readiness) probe display all details:
      show-details: always
  endpoints:
    web:
      # change the base path to "/":
      base-path: /
      exposure:
        # expose liveness, added by qudini-reactive-metrics,
        # expose health (aka readiness),
        # expose the monitoring system you're using (Prometheus here):
        include: liveness,health,prometheus
      path-mapping:
        # remap /health to /readiness
        health: readiness
        # remap /prometheus to /metrics
        prometheus: metrics
        # liveness already mapped to /liveness
```

If run locally, this will allow having the following endpoints available:

- `http://localhost:8080/`: your main app
- `http://localhost:8081/liveness`: your liveness probe
- `http://localhost:8081/readiness`: your readiness probe
- `http://localhost:8081/metrics`: your metrics, ready to be scraped

## Usage

### com.qudini.reactive.metrics.Measured 

Annotating a method with `@Measured` will make it available in the metrics endpoint via a `Timer` meter.

Three tags will be automatically added:

- `class_name` valued with the name of the class,
- `method_name` valued with the name of the method,
- `status`: either `success` or `error` depending on whether the method ended in error.

#### Example

```java
@Component
public class YourClass {

    @Measured("yourapp_duration")
    public Mono<String> yourMethod() {
        return ...;
    }

}
```

Prometheus output:

```text
# HELP yourapp_duration_seconds histogram
# TYPE yourapp_duration_seconds histogram
yourapp_duration_seconds_bucket{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod",status="success",le="0.005",} 4.0
yourapp_duration_seconds_bucket{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod",status="success",le="0.005592405",} 4.0
...
yourapp_duration_seconds_bucket{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod",status="success",le="5.0",} 4.0
yourapp_duration_seconds_bucket{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod",status="success",le="+Inf",} 4.0
yourapp_duration_seconds_count{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod",status="success",} 4.0
yourapp_duration_seconds_sum{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod",status="success",} 0.004546575
# HELP yourapp_duration_seconds_max histogram
# TYPE yourapp_duration_seconds_max gauge
yourapp_duration_seconds_max{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod",status="success",} 0.004407308
```

#### Diagrams

You can easily build RED diagrams with PromQL out of the above metrics.

##### Rate (per minute)

```text
sum(rate(yourapp_duration_seconds_count{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod"}[1m])*60 or 0*up)
```

##### Error rate (per minute)

```text
sum(rate(yourapp_duration_seconds_count{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod",status="error"}[1m])*60 or 0*up)
```

##### 50% percentile (aka average)

```text
histogram_quantile(0.50, sum(rate(yourapp_duration_seconds_bucket{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod"}[1m])) by (le))
```

##### 95% percentile (match your SLOs/SLAs)

```text
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(yourapp_duration_seconds_bucket{class_name="your.package.to.YourClass",method_name="yourMethod"}[1m])) by (le))
```

#### Customising the timer

As you can see above, histograms are published by default, with a minimum expected value of 5ms and a maximum expected value of 5s.

You can override those defaults via the annotation attributes:

```java
@Measured(
    value = "yourapp_duration",
    // below are the defaults you can override:
    description = "histogram",
    publishPercentileHistogram = true,
    minimumExpectedValueInMillis = 5,
    maximumExpectedValueInMillis = 5 * 1000
)
```

#### Using custom annotations

You can use custom annotations if you're feeling you're repeating yourself:

```java
@Target(METHOD)
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Measured("yourapp_duration", publishPercentileHistogram = false)
public @interface YourAppMeasured {
}
```

Then:

```java
@Component
public class YourClass {

    @YourAppMeasured
    public Mono<String> yourMethod() {
        return ...;
    }

}
```
